# Overview

As a developer, I want to make quality and efficent code that actually works. I have been programming for 15 years now and specifically have worked on various personal video game projects. I have seen way to many pieces of software from many companies ranging from websites and apps to videogames that release their product in a state that is riddled with bugs and and has more issues that only provide a poor user experience. For me, I want to make sure that whoever uses my software, whatever it is that I may have made, that they have an excellent user experienced and want to continue to use my software, or play my games.

This particular code prints Hellow World to the console.

This particular project was made for a class.
